There are very few moments in your life where you realize what you just saw is going to change the world as we know it. The first time you connected to the internet over a dial-up modem _(I’m old enough to have done so!)._ The first time you flicked the iPhone screen and saw the smooth and springy scroll. The first time Google Now told you to leave for the airport earlier due to excessive traffic. VR is one of those experiences.

It’s one of those things that set my mind racing with the opportunities we as designers and developers are going to have for changing the environment we live in:

-   You won’t need multiple screens on your workstation — you’ll need zero.
-   You won’t need to satisfy yourself by looking at pictures of places on Airbnb — you’ll just take a virtual walk around the place.
-   No one will need to be where they shouldn’t be — humanoids controlled by trained personnel wearing VR gear will replace humans in jobs that put the lives in danger.
-   You won’t need to imagine half the stuff you were asked to imagine in a science class in middle school — you’ll just see it happen right in front of you.
-   We won’t just watch the movies on screens, we would be in them. And also in everything from news events to sports broadcasts.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and if you’re a designer or a developer, one day soon enough you’ll be talking about designing VR-first experiences.

We still don’t know when exactly, but I’m glad I’m young enough that it’ll happen in my lifetime!

PS: I run a Virtual Reality Community on Commonlounge, where we host Q&A Sessions with industry experts and discuss curated news events in VR:
